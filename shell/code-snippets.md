# Code Snippets

- cat /etc/shells - gives overview of known shells on a linux system
- /etc/passwd - stores the default shell
- To switch from a one shell to another just type that shellâ€™s name e.g. zsh, bash, ksh, csh
- .zsh_history or .bash_history - stores history of all commands you have used on that shell
- adding a space before writing a shell command, executes the command while not storing it in history
