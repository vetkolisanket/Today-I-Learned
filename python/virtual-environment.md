# Virtual Environment in Python

## What is a virtual environment, why it is used?
Virtual environments in python allow different python projects to have their own isolated python environment, this is useful when say two different projects use the same library/dependency but its different version. In such cases having two different virtual environments for these two projects makes it possible to provide the correct library/dependency version to each of these projects. It is generally recommended to have separate virtual enviroments for each project.
